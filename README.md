# WordPress Scaffolding Plugin

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a template for WordPress plugin development. This should only be a bare bones template that adheres to the WordPress folder structure standard. I want this to be a good starting point for anyone who wants to create a new plugin with all the necessary boilerplate.

## Documentation 

I would like code examples using WordPress functions for common operations done using a plugin. I will list some here.

- Opening various files types and reading them.
- Looping through data
- Creating bulk pages from a data file.

## Resources 

I would like some links to helpful resources / documentation.
