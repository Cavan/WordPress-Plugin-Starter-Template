## Using These Examples

Each example includes:

- **Complete working code** that you can copy and adapt
- **Inline comments** explaining the logic
- **Error handling** following WordPress best practices
- **Security measures** like sanitization and validation

## Important Notes

### Before Using These Examples

1. **Test in a development environment** first
2. **Adapt to your needs** - these are starting points
3. **Follow WordPress coding standards**
4. **Add proper error handling** for production use
5. **Sanitize and validate** all user input

### WordPress Functions Used

These examples use core WordPress functions:

- `WP_Query` - For querying posts
- `wp_insert_post()` - For creating posts/pages
- `update_post_meta()` - For adding custom fields
- `get_terms()` - For retrieving taxonomy terms
- `file_get_contents()` - For reading files
- WordPress Filesystem API - For secure file operations

## Sample Data Files

The `/data` directory contains sample files for testing these examples:

- `example.txt` - Sample text file
- `example.csv` - Sample CSV with page data
- `example.json` - Sample JSON with page data

## Next Steps

Explore the specific example categories:

1. Start with [File Operations](file-operations) to understand file handling
2. Move to [Data Looping](data-looping) for data iteration patterns
3. Check [Bulk Page Creation](bulk-page-creation) for practical bulk operations
